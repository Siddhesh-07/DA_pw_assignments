The significance of Python keywords lies in their ability to provide structure, clarity, and readability to the code. Here are five examples of Python keywords and their significance:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. print(): This keyword is used to output text or a series of characters to the console. It is a built-in function that simplifies the process of displaying information in a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. if: The if keyword is used to create a conditional branch in a program. It allows the execution of a specific block of code only if the given condition is true. This keyword helps in creating decision-making logic in the code.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. while: The while keyword is used to create a loop that continues as long as a given condition is true. It is an iterative control structure that helps in executing a block of code multiple times based on a specific condition.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. class: The class keyword is used to define a new data type or a custom class in Python. It allows the creation of new objects and provides a blueprint for their attributes and methods. This keyword is essential for creating structured and organized code.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. def: The def keyword is used to create a new function in Python. It is a declaration keyword that takes an identifier (function name) as an argument, followed by the function's code (also known as the function body). This keyword is crucial for defining and organizing the logic and behavior of a program.\n"
